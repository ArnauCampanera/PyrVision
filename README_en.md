PyrVision is an Artificial Inteligence model developed at [Forest Science and Technology Center of Catalonia](https://www.ctfc.cat/en/) capable of automatically detecting up to 16 different classes of mammals and objects.

PyrVision uses [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/), the State-of-the-art architecture for object detection to offer the best performance in terms of speed and accuracy.
